# Retrospective
Minechem was one of the best mods I made for Minecraft back in the day, which was originally inspired after playing a bunch of Spacehem by Zachtronics.
I stopped working on this back in January 2013. Since then the project has passed through many hands:

# Minechem v2.0.0pr6.1
Adds chemistry to minecraft. Minechem comes with five machines.
* The Decomposer takes an item and decomposes it into it's chemical composition.
* The Synthesis machines takes elements and molecules and synthesis them into tangible items.
* The Microscope can inspect items to discover chemical compositions and recipes for the synthesis machine.
* The Blueprint projector takes a blueprint and projects a 3D representation of a structure. Used for building advanced machines.
* The Fusion chamber is built via the blueprint projector and combines the mass of two elements to create a single heavier element.
* The Hazmat suit reduces damage from radioactive elements.
* The Chemical storage will store chemicals and prevent them from decaying.
* The Chemistry Turtle will assist you with your chemical production line. (See wiki for more details on chemistry turtle).
